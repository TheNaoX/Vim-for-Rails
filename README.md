# Keyboard Layout

I use english keyboard layout since is the most efficient layout for development.
Also I use the Caps Lock key as control key. 


# Wish List

Things i want to include, build, improve, etc

* Git grep inside vim 
* mvim should open a new tab and pwd should be set to the current file
* running 'gvim' or 'gvim .' should open the NERDTREE by default and an empty window on the right


# Enjoy!
